-- Assignment 1 Ropes Part 3

The easiest way I can think of to go about appending or prepending additional text to a rope without traversing all
the way down to the leaf nodes and manipulating them would be to add a data field to the definition of Rope so that 
it would have a Prefix and an Affix field which are both pointers to Ropes. That way if you do an Append or Prepend
call then all you have to do is construct a new Rope as usual, and have the current existing Rope then point to the
newly created Rope. Then when traversing/printing a Rope you could do in-order traversal and just look for Prefix
and Affix nodes. This still seems like it would be an awful lot of work to implement though and there's probably a 
much more elegant solution but this would be my best guess.
