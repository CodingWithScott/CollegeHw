# This program will calculate the distance a car travels over
# predefined lengths of time, assuming a constant rate of speed.

# This program requires no user input, so I'll do calculations
# before outputting anything
hour_five_distance = 60 * 5
hour_eight_distance = 60 * 8
hour_twelve_distance = 60 * 12

# Here I output the results of the above calcuations
print 'There is a car traveling at exactly 60mph.'
print 'After 5 hours the car has traveled', hour_five_distance, 'miles.'
print 'After 8 hours the car has traveled', hour_eight_distance, 'miles.'
print 'After 12 hours the car has traveled', hour_twelve_distance, 'miles.'
