Once you have a string, you can use predefined Ada operations on arrays (since a string is simply an array of characters). These include the following: You can read or overwrite a Character (an element of a String) at a given index position. For example, A(2) refers to the character in string A at index position 2. Any attempt to read or write a nonexistent index position will cause the exception Constraint_Error to be raised. To change the character at a given position, simply assign to it, for example:   A(2) := 'f';    You can read or overwrite a slice (i.e., a substring). A slice refers to a portion of a string, from one index position to another, and is also considered a String. A slice from index position "low" to position "high" of some String variable B is written as "B(low..high)". You can write to a slice, too, but the source and destinations must have the same length.    You can assign a whole string from one String to another the same way as any other variable, as long as their lengths are equal, like this:
