Main game loop

NOTE: phase = global variable


Phase 0:
	set start time (current time)
	set end time (start time + timeout)
	Send Phase1 instructions:
		(schat(SERVER)(PLAN,R#))
	set Phase = 1
Phase 1:
	if timeout (current time > end time)
		for every player who hasn't chosen phase1 plan
			issue strike
			set plan to PASS

		Send Phase2 instructions
			for every player			
				for every alliance offered to player
					if alliance offers >= 2
						(schat(SERVER)(OFFER,R#,ALLY,ATTACKEE))
					elif alliance_offers == 1
						(schat(SERVER)(OFFERL,R#,ALLY,ATTACKEE))
					elife allince_offers == 0
						(schat(SERVER)(OFFERL,R#))

		set start time
		set end time (start time + timeout)
		set Phase = 2 
Phase 2:
	if timeout
		for every player 
			if player hasn't accepted/denied a phase2 plan:
				issue strike
				set plan to DECLINE
			elif player has accepted/denied a phase2 plan:
				send message to ally
				(schat(SERVER)(ACCEPT,R#,ALLY))
					or
				(schat(SERVER)(DENY,R#,ALLY))



		Send Phase 3 instructions
			for every player
				ask if player wishes to attack another player or pass


		set start time
		set end time
		set Phase = 3
Phase 3:
	if timeout
		battles to do = all players who agreed to attack another player

		for every battle to do (implementation for storing battles TBD)
			send battle notification
			compute battle results

		send sstat


		If not game_over, set phase = 1
