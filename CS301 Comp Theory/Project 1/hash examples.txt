(hash-has-key   hash map name     key name)
returns if there is a key of 'value' in a given hash map

make-hash
makes a new hash table

(hash-set!     hash map name       key name        new value)
sets the value of the given hash map with a given key

(hash-ref!      hash map name         key name       "")
gets the value from a given table associated with a given key name
there is some weird property at the end, I have no idea what it does,
but just put "" there and it should work fine.
